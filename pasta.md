# Pasta

This is how to make pasta. Very fancey.

## Ingredients

- Pasta, *200g*
- Water, *1700ml*
 - Currently testing amounts
- Butter, *1 Knob*
- Basil

## Prep

- Weigh Pasta, add into a seperate bowl

## Instructions

1. Fill a large pot with the water.
2. Salt the water profusely. The rule of thumb is that water for boiling pasta should taste as salty as the sea.
3. Bring water to a rolling boil (the water should be bubbling).
4. Add the pasta.
5. Keep it boiling, stirring every few minutes. Decrease heat as it tries to overflow.
6. Wait until pasta is at the preferred softness (~12 minutes [^1]), then strain it.
7. Optional: While the pasta is sitting in your strainer, season wth basil leaves, and other herbs.
8. Take a knob of room temperature butter (or margerine), and stir it through, melting it into the pasta.

## Notes

[^1]: The often recommended way to cook most pasta is *al dente*, which often means “still firm when bitten”. Overcooking will lead to a soggy mess.

Ask an italian an they'll tell you to fuck that shit up with water.
